Event Code Request Form
•  
• Event Codes are critical to perform any finance related action or create events within the LBS SA system.
• Event Codes should only be raised when an existing one from the Directory is unsuitable for the event.
• Event Code determines the VAT status of all payments related to the event (VAT liable or VAT exempt) - the description of the event and its ticketing details will determine the VAT status of the event.
• Finance Codes are auto-generated by the system and cannot be modified after issue.  ​
